These are my projects from Artificial Intelligence 2(CS 511) course in UIC. The tasks were to build the best agent which would capture the gold in the wumpus world by obtaining the highest scores.

I created the following agents as the part of this course:

1. Simple Reflex Agent:
   The agent reacts to the percepts at each step based on simple Condition - Action rules.

2. Model Based Agent:
   An internal model is constructed as the agent navigates through the environment and performs its actions based on the percepts and state of the environment.

3. Goal Based Agent:
   The agent uses utility based depth first search to do a forward search which branches out on actions and observations.
